It's true that all that you know is all that you are

                   <span>Gm</span>
You said that it's all that you want and more
 
<span>F7M</span>                         <span>C7M/G</span>
Fuck off and pour another drink
                       <span>Am7</span>
And tell me what you think
                  <span>Gm</span>                      <span>F7M</span>
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
                                  <span>C7M/G</span>
You put your cigarette out on my face
         <span>Am7</span>
So beautiful, please woman
<span>Gm</span>                         <span>F</span>
Don't break your back for me
           <span>Fm</span>
I'll put you out of your misery

 <span>C7M/G</span>
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
           <span>Am7</span>
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
 <span>D7</span>
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
      <span>F</span>              <span>Fm</span>
I'm here, but don't count on me to

<span>F7M</span>
Stay a little longer if you convince me

You tell me all the things that you have against me
<span>C7M/G</span>
Every time we make up, the truth is faded
<span>Am7</span>
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
<span>Gm</span>
Damn, who are we right now?

<span>F7M</span>
Can we have a little conversation?

Figure it out with no intoxication
<span>C7M/G</span>
We carry on, what is our motivation?
<span>Am</span>
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
<span>Gm</span>                       <span>F7M</span>
Maybe we're used to this

Tell me, what are we to do

It's like we only play to lose
<span>C7M/G</span>
Chasin' pain with an excuse
<span>Am7</span>
I love that shit and so do you
    <span>Gm</span>                           <span>F</span>
But don't break your back for me
             <span>Fm</span>
I'll put you out of your misery

<span>C7M/G</span>
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
           <span>Am7</span>
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
 <span>D7</span>
